This project was inspired by the Joshua AI machine from the incredible 1983 movie "WarGames." I thought of this while working on a project for my Cybersecurity class. This Tic Tac Toe project is Player vs. AI. It was made for a fictional character developed by my Cybersecurity teacher named "Mr. Bradpitt" and Mr. Bradpitt wanted to learn how the Internet works and what an OSI model was but he could only learn involving video games! So I made this game for Mr. Bradpitt with my understanding of Python and a bit of tips from online sources and now I am sharing it with you all.
